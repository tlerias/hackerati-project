=================

   I did this project in both Angular and in JQuery. Both use the same express server and css style sheet.

  ## JQUERY:
  * You can find the JQuery version in scripts/main.js
  * and the view for the JQuery version is in "root"/views/index.html
  * access the jquery version on the browser at localhost:3000/jquery

  ## ANGULAR:
  * You can find the Angular version in the browser at localhost:3000/
  * The script files for this can be found in scripts app.js, controller folder, services folder
  * view can be found in public/view
